# Web Development Guide

This is my another attempt at writing down best rules and practices in web software
development. This is not some theoretical discussion or rules for others.
Rather, it's a collection of best practices which a picked up over the years.

I did not invent any of the things I'm writing about. Either I stole them from people
who are smarter and better, or I discovered them the hard way - doing the same thing
over and over and learning along the way.

These rules are not a law which must be followed. Instead, they are best practicies which
I want to follow when it makes sense. They are practices relevent to what I work on,
to the tools and technologies I use, to the problems I solve. They might not work well,
or might not be applicable for other engineers. Also, they might become irrelevant for me
in a few year. Notherless, I think it's worth the time to write them down. First,
it might help others to understand who I am as a software engineer. Second, it will
remind me what rules I want to follow but do not necesserly do. Third, somebody might come
across this document and find it useful.

I'm writing this guide in markup so that I can turn it into a website. For the moment,
it will be just a set of markdown documents.
