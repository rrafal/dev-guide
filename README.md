# Web Development Guide

This is my guide into web development. I have picked up this knowledge over the years from courses,
books, articles and discussions with other software engineers. The information have been re-written
so that it express ideas the way I understand them.

These documents are meant to provide a quick intro into what is important to me. This is not a book
nor an education article. It's more of a notebook and work in progress.

I'm writing this guide in markup so that I can turn it into a website. For the moment,
it will be just a set of markdown documents.

The information has been devided into the following sections:
* [Software Engineering Principles](https://github.com/rrafal/dev-guide/blob/master/principles.md)
* [Development in Practice](https://github.com/rrafal/dev-guide/blob/master/practice.md)
* [Software Design Pattern](https://github.com/rrafal/dev-guide/blob/master/patterns.md)
